Comprehensive ZAP Reports
This section contains examples of comprehensive reports generated using OWASP ZAP — a popular open-source tool for automated web application security testing.
It includes real-world or demonstration reports in various formats (HTML, PDF, XML, and others), featuring:

A complete list of detected vulnerabilities, categorized by risk level (High, Medium, Low, Informational).
Detailed descriptions of each issue, including evidence, remediation recommendations, and references to CWE/OWASP standards.
Scanning statistics, alert summaries, and additional data (e.g., request/response history).

These examples are valuable for:

Studying the structure and content of professional security audit reports.
Comparing results from different ZAP configurations.
Serving as templates when preparing your own security audits.

In contrast to the simplified reports in other subsections, the focus here is on maximum detail and completeness of information.
